# Recursive SQL Examples

This file contains several examples of using recursive queries in SQL. Each example demonstrates a different use case for recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

## Examples

### Example 1: Generating a Sequence of Numbers
This example generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 using a recursive CTE.

### Example 2: Employee Hierarchy
This example creates an employee table and demonstrates how to use a recursive CTE to query the hierarchy starting from a specific employee.

### Example 3: Calculating Factorials
This example calculates the factorials of numbers from 1 to 5 using a recursive CTE.

### Example 4: Shortest Path in a Graph
This example demonstrates how to find the shortest path in a graph using a recursive CTE.

### Example 5: Category Tree
This example creates a category table and demonstrates how to use a recursive CTE to query the category hierarchy starting from a specific category.
